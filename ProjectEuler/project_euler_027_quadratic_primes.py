# Quadratic primes
#
# Problem 27
#
# Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:
#
# It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values . However, when is divisible
# by 41, and certainly when
#
# is clearly divisible by 41.
#
# The incredible formula
# was discovered, which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values
#
# . The product of the coefficients, −79 and 1601, is −126479.
#
# Considering quadratics of the form:
# n*n + an + b
# , where abs(a) < 1000 and abs(b) < 1000
#
# Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of ,
# starting with n = 0.
#


# 1. get list of first couple thousand primes
# 2. loop from -1000 to 1000, for both a and b
# 3. test the quadratic values
